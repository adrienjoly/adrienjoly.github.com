## What Iâ€™m doing these days

Iâ€™m home in Montreuil, Paris area, France.

- ðŸ’¼ I'm still working with [Signaux Faibles](https://beta.gouv.fr/startups/signaux-faibles.html) but I'm preparing my transition to new missions.

  > Check out my new "pro" page: [adrienjoly.com/pro](/pro)

- ðŸŽ“ I've started [teaching](/teaching) Node.js programming to 4 classes, remotely.

  > Most recent victory: a successful mob programming session! Check out [this happy tweet](https://twitter.com/adrienjoly/status/1334413690477703168).

  > Also, I'm developing a new tool to help me assess my students remotely: [_Ã‰noncÃ©_](https://github.com/adrienjoly/enonce).
  
- ðŸŒ¶ With my band "[Harissa](https://www.facebook.com/harissaquartet)", we finished recording our album "[Radio DÃ©sert](https://harissa.bandcamp.com/album/radio-d-sert)" and we are currently discussing the recoding of videos!

- â›‘ During locked-down weekends, I enjoy working on [side projects](/prod). Recently, I've been spending quite some time fixing and refactoring [Openwhyd](https://github.com/openwhyd/openwhyd).

- ðŸ¥Š To stay fit and energized, I still enjoy my daily VR exercise routine on the [Oculus Quest](/vr). I've been mostly playing with "Rush", "Pistol Whip" and "Synth Riders", lately.

- ðŸ›‹ And, to relax, I also enjoy playing games using Google Stadia: "Grid" and "Tomb Raider", from the comfort of my couch ^^
