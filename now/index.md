## What Iâ€™m doing these days

Iâ€™m home in Montreuil, Paris area, France. (Note: currently looking for a bigger flat)

- ðŸ’¼ Developing a Algolia's [Site-Search Crawler](https://www.algolia.com/solutions/site-search) and making sure that it works as great as possible in production, for our customers. I am currently the Tech Lead of that project.
  
- ðŸŽ“ [**Teaching**](/teaching) back-end programming with Node.js, tech leadership and how to collaborate on open source projects using `git`.
  
- ðŸŒ¶ Looking for gigs with my **band** "[Harissa](https://www.facebook.com/harissaquartet)", now that our first EP "[Karabana](https://cabaneariff.com/harissa-karabana)" is available publicly on all music platforms (e.g. on Spotify). Opportunities are welcome, if you have any! ðŸ¤—
  
- â›‘ Making sure that [openwhyd.org](https://openwhyd.org) ([open-source](https://github.com/openwhyd) music curation platform) keeps working as expected. You can help us sustain our product and community of music lovers by [contributing](https://openwhyd.org/contribute) and/or [donating](https://openwhyd.org/donate).

- ðŸ›  When I have some energy left, I develop, ship and maintain [side projects](/prod). Also, I'm exploring the idea of performing 8-bit music from the Nintendo/NES era (a.k.a. chiptune videogame music) live.
