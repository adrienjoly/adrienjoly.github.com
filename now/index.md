## What I’m doing these days

I’m home in Montreuil, Paris area, France.

- 🐈 Camille and I are enjoying our new flat and taking care of our two adorable kittens, in Montreuil.

- 💼 I left Algolia to join [SHODO](https://shodo.io/), a consulting company specialized in Software Crafts(wo)manship.

  > Check out this [excellent overview of Software Craft by Yannick Grenzinger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FzIuAImNcis)" (1-hour video presentation, in French)

- 🎓 [Teaching](/teaching) back-end programming with Node.js at EEMI and ESGI, in Paris.
  
- 🌶 Recording an album with my band "[Harissa](https://www.facebook.com/harissaquartet)", as a sequel to our first EP: "[Karabana](https://cabaneariff.com/harissa-karabana)".

  > We also love giving concerts. Opportunities are welcome! 🤗
  
- ⛑ Making sure that [openwhyd.org](https://openwhyd.org) ([open-source](https://github.com/openwhyd) music curation platform) keeps working as expected, and promoting it to developers through [Hackergarten](https://www.meetup.com/fr-FR/Paris-Hackergarten) and [ProgrammableWeb](https://www.programmableweb.com/api/openwhyd-user).

  > We are open to [contributions](https://openwhyd.org/contribute) and/or [donations](https://openwhyd.org/donate).

- 🎲 Between the development of my [side projects](/prod), I'm having a lot of fun trying out immersive experiences (including VR fitness 🥊) with my Oculus Quest virtual reality headset!
