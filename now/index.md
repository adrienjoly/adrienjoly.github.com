## What Iâ€™m doing these days

Iâ€™m home in Montreuil, Paris area, France.

- ðŸ’¼ Developing a **web crawler** at [Algolia](https://www.algolia.com/).
  
- ðŸŽ“ Preparing **teaching interventions** for 2018-2019, about Node.js programming, tech leadership and quality software engineering (incl. software design, automated testing, git/github flow, lean &amp; agile project management).
  
- ðŸŒ¶ Recording an album with my **band** "[Harissa](https://www.facebook.com/harissaquartet)".
  
- â›‘ Making sure that [openwhyd.org](https://openwhyd.org) ([open-source](https://github.com/openwhyd)) keeps working as expected.

- ðŸ›  When I still have some energy left, I develop, ship and maintain [side projects](/prod).

- ðŸ”Œ Current topics of interest: exploring FM synthesis (e.g. Adlib/OPL3, sonic-pi), trying to repair a wake-up light (electronics), and helping a friend develop a multi-track MIDI real-time recorder and sequencer for raspberry pi.
