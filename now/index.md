## What I’m doing these days

I’m home in Montreuil, Paris area, France.

- 🏠 Since Thursday, March 12th, Camille and I are confined at home, to reduce the spread of the COVID-19/Coronavirus. Fortunately, we have a great fiber connection to the Internet and two adorable 🐈 kittens to join us in this fight!

- 🎓 I'm still [teaching](/teaching) back-end / API programming with Node.js. Last week, I gave a 5-day class to 20 students, from home! It was challenging but it went well. 😌
  
- 💼 On March 2nd, I joined [SHODO](https://shodo.io/) as a consultant. And I started my first mission on March 23rd, at [Signaux Faibles](https://beta.gouv.fr/startups/signaux-faibles.html), a startup company that developed a data pipeline to detect which companies may need financial support from the government. I'm very happy to join this team, and I've enjoyed practicing TDD and pair programming with them!

- 🌶 With my band "[Harissa](https://www.facebook.com/harissaquartet)", we finished recording our album and we are currently discussing the recoding of videos!

  > We also love giving concerts. Opportunities are welcome! 🤗
  
- ⛑ Besides, I'm still spending some spare time on [side projects](/prod), notably [openwhyd.org](https://openwhyd.org) ([open-source](https://github.com/openwhyd) music curation platform), to make sure that it keeps working as expected and promote it to potential contributors.

  > We are open to [contributions](https://openwhyd.org/contribute) and/or [donations](https://openwhyd.org/donate).

- 🎲 Now that I can't go out much, I'm happy to use my Oculus Quest every day, for my daily VR 🥊 exercise routine, but also to play games with my friends. (e.g. Crisis VRigade is awesome, I recommend it!)
