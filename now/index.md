## What Iâ€™m doing these days

Iâ€™m home in Montreuil, Paris area, France.

- ðŸ‘ž &nbsp; One month after foot surgery, I'm finally able to get back on my feet and walk! \o/

- ðŸ’¼  &nbsp; I've been working with the technical team of [Choose](https://appchoose.io/) since April 2021, to help them industrialize some parts of their back-end software.

- ðŸŽ“  &nbsp; Now that I'm freed from my [teaching](/teaching) engagements, I'm working on new projects with some colleagues from SHODO. I will make announcements on Twitter and LinkedIn soon!

- ðŸŒ¶  &nbsp; I can't wait to be able to give concerts again, with my band "[Harissa](https://www.facebook.com/harissaquartet)"!

  > Our album, "[Radio DÃ©sert](https://harissa.bandcamp.com/album/radio-d-sert)", is available on most music platforms.

- ðŸ›°  &nbsp; To relax, I still enjoy playing (almost) everyday on my [Oculus Quest](/vr), mostly exploring planets in [No Man's Sky](https://www.nomanssky.com/) and flying with the Resistance in [Star Wars Squadrons](https://www.ea.com/games/starwars/squadrons).
