## What Iâ€™m doing these days

Iâ€™m home in Montreuil, Paris area, France.

- ðŸ’¼ I'm transitioning from a year-long mission for [Signaux Faibles](https://beta.gouv.fr/startups/signaux-faibles.html) to a new client: [Choose](https://appchoose.io/).

  > For more information about what I can do for your business, check out [adrienjoly.com/pro](/pro).

- ðŸŽ“ After I'm done with my [teaching](/teaching) engagements for this year, I've decided to move on to other projects.

- ðŸŒ¶ I miss rehearsing and giving concerts with my band "[Harissa](https://www.facebook.com/harissaquartet)"...

  > Our album, "[Radio DÃ©sert](https://harissa.bandcamp.com/album/radio-d-sert)", is available on most music platforms.

- ðŸ¥Š To escape from this long COVID-19 lockdown, I've enjoyed exploring planets in [No Man's Sky](https://www.nomanssky.com/), on my [Oculus Quest](/vr).
