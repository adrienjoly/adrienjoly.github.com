## What Iâ€™m doing these days

Iâ€™m home in Montreuil, Paris area, France. (*Note: currently looking for a bigger flat*)

- ðŸ’¼ Developing Algolia's [Site-Search Crawler](https://www.algolia.com/solutions/site-search) and maintaining it in production for our customers. <br/> I have been the Tech Lead of that project since January 2019. Read the story I wrote about [our migration to Kubernetes](https://blog.algolia.com/challenging-migration-heroku-google-kubernetes-engine/).

- âœ¨ Learning about clean code / software craft practices, by learning from experienced crafters and practicing TDD (Test Driven Development) and pair programming. This article gives a good introduction to that topic: [How to Write a Good Piece of Code](https://dev.to/taillogs/how-to-write-a-good-piece-of-code-2gmj).
  
- ðŸŽ“ [Teaching](/teaching) back-end programming with Node.js, tech leadership and how to collaborate on collaborative projects (including open source) using `git`.
  
- ðŸŒ¶ Always happy to accept concert opportunities for my band "[Harissa](https://www.facebook.com/harissaquartet)", now that our first EP "[Karabana](https://cabaneariff.com/harissa-karabana)" is available publicly on all music platforms (e.g. on Spotify). Please let me know if you think of someone who would enjoy to have us perform for them! ðŸ¤—
  
- â›‘ Making sure that [openwhyd.org](https://openwhyd.org) ([open-source](https://github.com/openwhyd) music curation platform) keeps working as expected, and promoting it to developers through [Hackergarten](https://www.meetup.com/fr-FR/Paris-Hackergarten) and [ProgrammableWeb](https://www.programmableweb.com/api/openwhyd-user). We are open to [contributions](https://openwhyd.org/contribute) and/or [donations](https://openwhyd.org/donate).

- ðŸ›  When I have some energy left, I develop, ship and maintain [side projects](/prod). <br/> Also, I'm exploring the [idea](https://hackmd.io/nszFj8pcTAynVP04-GUePw) of performing 8-bit music from the Nintendo/NES era (a.k.a. chiptune videogame music) live.
