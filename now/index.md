## What Iâ€™m doing these days

Iâ€™m home in Montreuil, Paris area, France.

- ðŸ’¼ Developing a **web crawler** at [Algolia](https://www.algolia.com/) and making sure that it works as great as possible in production, for our customers.
  
- ðŸŽ“ [**Teaching**](/teaching) back-end programming with Node.js, tech leadership and how to collaborate on open source projects using `git`.
  
- ðŸŒ¶ Looking for gigs with my **band** "[Harissa](https://www.facebook.com/harissaquartet)", now that our first EP "[Karabana](https://cabaneariff.com/harissa-karabana)" is available publicly on all music platforms (e.g. on Spotify). Opportunities are welcome, if you have any! ðŸ¤—
  
- â›‘ Making sure that [openwhyd.org](https://openwhyd.org) ([open-source](https://github.com/openwhyd) music curation platform) keeps working as expected. You can help us sustain our product and community of music lovers by [contributing](https://openwhyd.org/contribute) and/or [donating](https://openwhyd.org/donate).

- ðŸ›  When I still have some energy left, I develop, ship and maintain [side projects](/prod).

- ðŸ”Œ Current topics of interest: learning about tech team management, music composition and FM synthesis (e.g. Adlib/OPL3, sonic-pi).
