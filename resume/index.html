            <h3>A Context Management Framework based on Wisdom of Crowds for Social Awareness applications</h3>
            <strong>PhD Thesis @ INSA Lyon - Institut National des Sciences AppliquÃ©es de Lyon</strong>
            <p>2010</p>
            <p>At a time when social networking sites revolutionize the usages on the Web 2.0, it has become rich, easy, and fun to share private or professional content. Sharing personal information in real-time (such as news, moods, etc ), supports the maintenance of social ties at a high scale. However, the information overload which emerged from the growing quantity of signals exchanged on these services, often in real-time, motivates a regulation of these signals (called &quot;mediated interactions&quot;), in order to reduce the temporal cost for maintaining social networks, and implied interruptions, which have a negative impact on productivity on tasks that require long-lasting attention. In the frame of this thesis, we have developed a filtering and recommendation system that relies on contextual similarity between users that produce and consume social signals, as relevance criteria. In our approach, contextual information is aggregated and interpreted on users&#39; terminal(s), before being submitted on-demand to a server in the form of a set of weighted tags. In this thesis, we present a broad state of the art on context-awareness, social networks and information retrieval, we propose a formalization of our filtering problem, and we implement and evaluate its application for enterprise social networking.</p>

            <p>I found Adrien to be proactive, autonomous, very competent in all things software, all-in-all a passionate character. Adrien is a valuable asset for any team in research, development or innovation, for his large scope of ideas, dynamism and open mind. He is also a very good drummer! -

            <p>Adrien&#39;s capacity to ask the right questions, his motivation to define new scenarios that help people in their communication needs were key in the success of my Master thesis and the resulting publication. By having Adrien as a supervisor you have the certainty of fully enjoying each moment of your work. -
