Between 2015 and 2021, I taught hundreds of students how to develop software in JavaScript and Node.js. (see the [Past interventions](#past-interventions) section, below)

During that period, I experimented the use of various tools and developed my own, to help students understand and practice more effectively, and to assess their understanding reliably and fairly.

## Pedagogical Tools I've Used

Here is a list of tools I have regularly used to teach classes and assess the understanding of my students.

### Communication platforms

- [Markdown + Jekyll on GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/): I write my course material (i.e. mostly guided exercises) in Markdown format and publish it for free, thanks to GitHub Pages.
- [GitHub private repositories](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/githubs-products#github-free): I maintain several private repositories in GitHub, to keep the exams I gave to all my students, and their solutions.
- [Google Classroom](https://edu.google.com/products/classroom) is a platform that one of the schools where I teach has been using to create a virtual space for each classroom, to support communication between students and teachers and to submit assignments.
- [Google Forms](https://www.google.com/forms/about): to gather code and answers from students, during paper-less exams.
- [Straw Poll](https://www.strawpoll.me/): to regularly poll the progress of students on the exercises I gave them. It helps me decide when it's most helpful to provide more tips on how to solve a particular exercice, to prevent students from being stuck for too long. Especially useful for remote classes.

### Tools to practice coding skills

- [Tech.io](https://tech.io/): During COVID-19 lockdown, I wrote exercise testers on the Tech.io platform so that students get useful feedback on their code while working autonomously on coding exercises.
- [Repl.it](https://repl.it/): I use this free online IDE to quickly write, re-format, run and share JavaScript programs to my students.
- [Codingame](https://www.codingame.com/): I use this free online server to make my students collaborate on solving algorithmic problems together, by mob programming in the classroom. It's also a fun way to train individually.

### Assessment tools I developed

- I developed [Ã©noncÃ©](https://github.com/adrienjoly/enonce) to publish and distribute paper-less exam exercises to my students, expressed in Markdown, and using subtle variants for each student (based on their Student ID) to discourage them from exchanging answers.
- [gclass](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gclass): a CLI to quickly collect the projects submitted by my students through Google Classroom assignments, and store them in a flat text file, for offline batch processing.
- [classroom-submissions-to-pdf](https://github.com/adrienjoly/classroom-submissions-to-pdf): to generate a PDF file that contains the code submitted by all my students on a Google Classroom assignment, so I can review and annotate it on my iPad. (see video demo: [How to evaluate students' code by hand, and without paper - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7NQNe72Jec))
- [Survey Response Browser](https://survey-response-browser.herokuapp.com/): to generate a PDF file that contains the assignments submitted by all my students on Google Forms, so I can review, annotate and return their responses using my iPad. (e.g. thanks to [PDF Master](http://www.appxy.com/pdf-master/))
- [`js-test`](https://github.com/adrienjoly/js-test): to give auto-graded exercises or exams (including coding exercises) to my students. I wrote this open-source toolkit to help me design exercises and auto-grading scripts, deploy them online, gather answers from students and generate a graded feedback sheets that I return to students.
