## 2019-2020

- [Back-end development with Node.js](https://adrienjoly.com/cours-nodejs/) (32h), at [EEMI](http://www.eemi.com/) and [ESGI](https://www.esgi.fr) (Paris, France)

### Pedagogical Tools I Use

Here is a list of tools I regularly use for teaching classes and assessing the understanding of my students:

- [Markdown + Jekyll on GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/): I write my course material (i.e. mostly guided exercises) in Markdown format and publish it with GitHub Pages. (free)
- [Repl.it](https://repl.it/): I use this free online IDE to quickly write, re-format, run and share JavaScript programs to my students.
- [Codingame](https://www.codingame.com/): I use this free online server to make my students collaborate on solving algorithmic problems together, by mob programming in the classroom. It's also a fun way to train individually.
- [Straw Poll](https://www.strawpoll.me/): to regularly poll the progress of students on the exercises I gave them. It helps me decide when it's most helpful to provide more tips on how to solve a particular exercice, to prevent students from be stuck for too long. Especially useful for remote classes.
- [Google Forms](https://www.google.com/forms/about): to create small quizzes (i.e. mostly at the end of each class), quickly gather scores and results from students. This helps me determine which topic needs to be re-explained to my students.
- [Survey Response Browser](https://survey-response-browser.herokuapp.com/): to generate a PDF file that contains the code submitted by all my students on a Google Form, so I can review, annotate and return their responses using my iPad. (e.g. thanks to [PDF Master](http://www.appxy.com/pdf-master/))
- [classroom-submissions-to-pdf](https://github.com/adrienjoly/classroom-submissions-to-pdf): to generate a PDF file that contains the code submitted by all my students on a Google Classroom assignment, so I can review and annotate it on my iPad. (see video demo: [How to evaluate students' code by hand, and without paper - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7NQNe72Jec))
- [classroom-assignments-cli](https://github.com/adrienjoly/classroom-assignments-cli): to quickly collect the URLs submitted by my students through Google Classroom assignments, and store them in a flat text file, for batch processing.
- [`js-test`](https://github.com/adrienjoly/js-test): to give auto-graded exercises or exams (including coding exercises) to my students. I wrote this open-source toolkit to help me design exercises and auto-grading scripts, deploy them online, gather answers from students and generate a graded feedback sheets that I return to students. (see video demos: ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡· [Ã‰valuer efficacement ses Ã©tudiants - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmzn1C-VN6G7DsJb9wn29Pv2XkrF8aI6Q))
- [GitHub private repositories](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/githubs-products#github-free): I maintain several private repositories in GitHub, to keep the exams I gave to all my students, and their solutions.
- [Google Classroom: manage teaching and learning](https://edu.google.com/products/classroom) is the platform that one of the schools where I teach has been using to create a virtual space for each classroom, to support communication between students and teachers and to submit assignments.

## Fall 2018

- [Use of `git` for collaborative and open source projects (4h)](https://adrienjoly.com/cours-git/), at [EEMI](http://www.eemi.com/) (Paris, France)

## Past interventions

Between October 2015 and June 2018, I was giving a Web Programming Basics with JavaScript course (~40 hours) to 4 classes of 1st-year students, at [EEMI](http://www.eemi.com/) (Paris, France).
