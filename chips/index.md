title: The Chips Project
description: A musical and technological project about performing chiptunes live
---

The vision of this project is:

- to give an [educational concert about chiptune music](https://hackmd.io/nszFj8pcTAynVP04-GUePw) during which musicians would perform 8-bit music from the Nintendo/NES era, live, using MIDI instruments plugged to a synthesizer;

- to develop [our own chiptune synthesizer](https://adrienjoly.com/webmidi-launchkey-mini/) and tools that would be used to give that live performance, as open source software that anybody can run for free on their web browser.
