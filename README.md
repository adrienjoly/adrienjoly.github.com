# Adrien Joly 

ℹ️ [This repository](https://github.com/adrienjoly/adrienjoly.github.com/settings) contains the source code of my personal website: [adrienjoly.com](https://adrienjoly.com).

## Personal README

The objective of this page is to introduce myself and share some information that maybe helpful to communicate, collaborate and adjust expectations effectively with me.

In it, I share my professional and personal values, what drives me, what makes me grumpy, and what my workflow is like.

It will probably be useful mostly for my colleagues and collaborators (current and future) to read.
