ℹ️ [This repository](https://github.com/adrienjoly/adrienjoly.github.com/settings) contains the source code of my personal website: [adrienjoly.com](https://adrienjoly.com).

## Personal README

The objective of this page is to introduce myself and share some information that maybe helpful to communicate, collaborate and adjust expectations effectively with me.

In it, I share my professional and personal values, what drives me, what makes me grumpy, and what my workflow is like.

It will probably be useful mostly for my colleagues and collaborators (current and future) to read.

### Quick Bio

I was born and raised in the south of France. I lived in many different places, with and without my family: 2 years in Dakar, Senegal when I was 7, 1 year in the countryside (near Albi), spent most of my middle and high school years on the Corsica island, then 2 years in Aix-en-Provence (where my parents are still based now), 2 years in Lyon, 1 year in Australia, and now I'm based in Montreuil, near Paris. I like to think that these travels made me more open-minded and adaptable to new environments.

I was lucky enough to discover my passions at a very young age: when I was 6, my father got a PC (a 386 with a 16 MHz CPU and 2 MB of RAM) at home and let me play with it, and I started taking drum lessons at the same time. As a kid, I had a few good friends but I was not generally found of hanging out with other kids. I prefered spending time alone (in my bubble) or in very small groups of close friends, tidying up my bedroom to perfection and learning how to make cool stuff on my father's computer.

As a teenager, I was excited about finally being able to leave high school and putting more focus on developing my career in computer science. I had initially planned to quickly get a Bachelor's degree and then start looking for a job as software developer, but ended up studying much longer. I became an engineer, and then got a PhD, just because I though that doing a thesis was the best way for me to innovate and "change the world". Once settled in Paris, I discovered that what I actually wanted was to join a start-up company, and maybe someday start my own.

Today, I share my time between many activities: leading a software development team at Algolia, teaching software in several schools, performing music with my band "Harissa", and developing several side-projects (mostly related to software and/or music) on my own.

### Characteristics

- I love exploring new ideas and build prototypes.
- I'm good at documenting and maintaining the projects I've worked on, to make sure that they are still operational for their users.
- More generally, I love to solve problems that I'm curious about, learn about how other people work, and share my learnings.
- I can be good at planning and solving conflicts between people, but I don't enjoy doing that for too long. I do it because I fear uncertainty, conflicts and immobilism.
- I'm obcessed with efficiency and improvement in general. This makes me exigent with others, but also with myself. Playing drums with other people is one of the rare activities that makes my brain shut up and makes me let go of my anxieties.
- Some people think that I am cold. In reality, I just look very serious when I think, and I think a lot. If I look cold while you're talking to me, it does not mean that I'm mad at you or that I don't care. It means that I'm actually listening and reflecting on what you're saying.
- That said, I hate bullshit and wasting people's time (including mine), so I won't beat around the bush if you ask me for feedback or my opinion. If you want to be encouraged rather then advised, make sure that I got your intent clearly!
- As an introvert, I need more alone time than most people to recharge and prepare for interactions with others. I can easily feel uncomfortable when I face an unexpected situation in a social setting.
- I prefer giving presentations than attending them. Probably because the conversations that I may have with people after giving a talk are less likely to be small talk.
- I enjoy going out to share good beers and traditional food. I prefer to do this with small groups of friends and acquaintances. I feel more and more uncomfortable in environments that are noisy and/or crowded.
- Finally, my memory can be quite picky at times. I can have a hard time remembering people's names and even recognizing their face, especially if we've met only once or twice, and haven't seen each other in a long time. I really appreciate it when people go ahead and give me hints to help me recognize them: what they do, where we've met, who we know in common, what we've talked about. So, please don't be offended if I seem to ignore you or to be cold with you. I never ignore anybody on purpose. I may just need a hint. ^^

### What are my favorite things to work on

- Coding. Shipping code that works.
- Refactoring.
- Writing automated tests.
- Writing course material and exercises for my students.

### What I value from others

- Efficiency & conciseness. Life is too short to beat around the bush! 
- Honesty. I despise bullshit. And I feel hurt when people that I trust lie to me or hide stuff from me.
- Growth mindset. Nobody's perfect. The important thing to accept it and don't waste opportunities to improve.

### What I think are my strengths

- Accountability. If I say that I'm going do something, I will deliver. I hate to lie, disappoint, and I'm not afraid to be transparent.
- Resourcefulness. I'm good at detecting improvement opportunities and coming up with creative solutions.
- Pedagogy. I love to help people understand stuff.

### Things I'm working to improve

- Leadership. I am learning to tap into my team-mate's strengths and ideas, rather than imposing my own plan.
- Emotional Intelligence. Dealing with people's emotions (and my own) has not been easy for me.
- Conflict management. I can feel uncomfortable when conflicts happen. It's important to stay calm and contribute to resolving situations.
- Marketing and communication. I would love to become better at creating enthusiasm when I communicate about achievements and projects.

### What makes me grumpy

- Witnessing Injustice. When people are not acting in a fair way.
- When people show disrespect towards me or anyone else.
- Doing chores or things that don't scale.
- Lack of order and consistency, especially when I have to get involved. (e.g. in a codebase that I find hard to understand)

### How to know when I'm (really) grumpy

Great question! Unfortunately, it may be tricky to find out, at times... Especially when I'm grumpy for a reason that I had already explained. Maybe it would help me be more transparent with this if you asked me whenever you're in doubt about my grumpiness?

### What have my past managers done that I like

- Defend the interests of the team.
- Congratulate successes and efforts, and provide honest feedback to help team-mates improve.
- Take the time to share useful tips and provide coaching when appropriate.
- Not be afraid to roll up their sleeves and help out when times are tough.

### What I do outside of work

- I play drums in a band. I love it when we give concerts!
- Watch YouTube videos about developers who crafted video games, and music programming for vintage video games. (chiptunes)
- Prototyping and maintaining several side projects, for fun and learning.
- Soldering stuff. I find it very calming and satisfying.

### Things I’d love to do in the future

- Be able to fly, in any way.
- Fly in a modern fighter aircraft, like the Rafale.
- Travel in Asian by train.
- Maybe someday: create my own company.

### Preferred Communication Method

Email! I know that most people don't like email. The fact that email is an asynchronous communication medium gives me more flexibility and time to reply. I find Slack and synchronous communication too intrusive in most cases, because it can interrupt me when I'm focused.
For that reason, I disable all notifications, including for SMS!

### Working Hours

I am usually operational at my desk between 10am and 6pm everyday. When it's possible, I like to take my lunch break at 12pm.
I avoid working after-hours.
