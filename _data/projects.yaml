    I teach <b>JavaScript programming</b> to three classes of 1st year students, at the Ecole Européenne des Métiers de l'Internet. The first school founded by Xavier Niel (Free), Antoine Granjon (vente-privee.com), and Marc Simoncini (Meetic). I also craft modern pedagogical tools for my students, and for automated evaluation.

    I built the <b>full stack</b> of <a href="https://openwhyd.org/" target="_blank">Openwhyd</a> (formerly known as whyd.com), a web-based music curation platform that allows adding tracks using a browser extension (<b>bookmarklet</b>), and plays them in sequence. After open-sourcing the product, I'm now leading its community of contributors.

    I forked an existing spellchecking extension for <b>Visual Studio Code</b>, and switched it to another engine, so that it can find errors and suggest corrections in text files in French language. I use it to write my JavaScript course material.

    In the frame of my Javascript course at EEMI, I developed an online exam application for students, using <b>Google Polymer</b> and <b>Firebase</b>. It was designed to display different variants of each exercise to prevent fraud, and automatic student evaluation/grading.
