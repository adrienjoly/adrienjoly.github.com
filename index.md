Hi!

My name is Adrien. I'm a French guy who currently lives in Montreuil, Paris area, France.

As a software engineer, I **develop full-stack web products**: notably a [crawler for Algolia](https://www.algolia.com/solutions/site-search). I've also maintained several [side projects](/prod), including: [Next Step for Trello](https://adrienjoly.com/chrome-next-step-for-trello), [Startup Tour](https://www.udemy.com/startuptour/?couponCode=AJNOW20) and [Openwhyd](https://github.com/openwhyd/openwhyd). They are all free to use and/or open source on [my GitHub](https://github.com/adrienjoly/).

I enjoy **sharing what I learn**: by teaching, [giving talks](/talks), [writing articles](/posts), [research publications](https://scholar.google.fr/citations?user=BI3HXcsAAAAJ) and by [replying to questions on Quora](https://www.quora.com/profile/Adrien-Joly), occasionally. In the past, I organized [Angelhack](http://www.hackathon.io/angelhack18) and [fHACKtory hackathons](https://www.maddyness.com/?s=fhacktory), in Paris and Lyon.

Last but not least, I love **playing drums** with my band [Harissa](https://www.facebook.com/harissaquartet/) and during jam sessions. Previously, I recorded [an album](https://www.discogs.com/fr/Man-Is-Not-A-Bird-Survived-The-Great-Flood/master/870529) with Man Is Not A Bird (my previous band), among [other musical adventures](/music).

You can read what I'm doing [now](/now), listen to [my musical discoveries on Openwhyd](https://openwhyd.org/adrien) and follow my updates on twitter: [@adrienjoly](http://twitter.com/adrienjoly).

If you want to say hi, you can email me: contact @ this domain name. (I prefer [email](https://medium.com/@adrienjoly/why-email-does-not-stink-9267c948f3f9#.g63r0gqsu) to [phone calls](https://byrslf.co/why-i-don-t-answer-most-phone-calls-4a71e1418854)) ðŸ˜‡
