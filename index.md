Hi!

My name is Adrien Joly (he/him). I live in Montreuil, Paris area, France.

As a software engineer and tech lead, I **develop full-stack web applications** and operate them in production. (e.g. [Algolia's Crawler](https://www.algolia.com/products/crawler/)) I've also maintained several [projects](/prod), mostly free to use and/or open source ([on GitHub](https://github.com/adrienjoly/)), including:
- productivity tools; (e.g. [Next Step for Trello](https://adrienjoly.com/chrome-next-step-for-trello) and [Scribe bot for Telegram](https://github.com/adrienjoly/telegram-scribe-bot))
- education material; (e.g. [Startup Tour](https://www.udemy.com/startuptour/?couponCode=AJNOW20), [js-test](https://github.com/adrienjoly/js-test) and a [Node.js course](/teaching))
- and products for music lovers and musicians. (e.g. [Openwhyd](https://openwhyd.org), [Album Shelf](https://github.com/adrienjoly/album-shelf) and [a chiptune synthesizer made with WebMIDI](https://github.com/adrienjoly/webmidi-launchkey-mini))

I enjoy **sharing what I learn**: by [teaching](/teaching), giving [talks](/talks) and writing [articles](/posts). In the past, I organized [Angelhack](http://www.hackathon.io/angelhack18) and [fHACKtory](https://www.maddyness.com/?s=fhacktory) hackathons, in Paris and Lyon.

I also love **playing drums** with my band [Harissa](https://www.facebook.com/harissaquartet/) and during jam sessions. Among various [musical adventures](/music), I recorded two albums:
- [Karabana](https://ampl.ink/WknK7), with Harissa;
- and [Survived The Great Flood](https://www.discogs.com/fr/Man-Is-Not-A-Bird-Survived-The-Great-Flood/master/870529), with Man Is Not A Bird (my previous band).
