Hi!

My name is Adrien Joly (he/him). I live in Montreuil, Paris area, France.

As a **Software Crafter** and **Tech Lead**, I develop full-stack web applications (mostly with TypeScript and Node.js), operate them in production and help teams fight against legacy code and technical debt. (see [my services](/pro) ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ / ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡· [prestations](/pro/fr))

I enjoy **sharing what I've learned**, by:

- [teaching](/teaching),
- giving [talks](/talks),
- writing [articles](/posts)
- and maintaining [open-source projects](/prod).

I also love **playing drums** with my band [Harissa](https://www.facebook.com/harissaquartet/) and during jam sessions. Among various [musical adventures](/music), I recorded two albums: [Radio DÃ©sert](https://harissa.bandcamp.com/album/radio-d-sert) and [Survived The Great Flood](https://www.discogs.com/fr/Man-Is-Not-A-Bird-Survived-The-Great-Flood/master/870529). (with my previous band: Man Is Not A Bird)
