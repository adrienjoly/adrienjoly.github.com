## First steps with Oculus Quest

<!-- from https://twitter.com/adrienjoly/status/1161896322699603968 -->

If you recently bought an Oculus Quest, welcome to the club!

Here are a few tips and recommendations for you:

- You can play **seated**, either by changing game settings or reducing your height in your Oculus profile
- Long-press Oculus button to **re-center the view** in direction of your choice
- You "side load" games and experiences that are not listed on your Oculus store (including Oculus Go games) by [installing SideQuest](https://sidequestvr.com/#/setup-howto) on PC or Mac
- [moonrider.xyz](https://moonrider.xyz/) = **Beat Saber** for free
- Try **climbing** in [VRChat](https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/1856672347794301/) (free)
- Play **paintball** with your friends in [RecRoom](https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/2173678582678296) (free)
- Try **zero-gravity** exploration of the [ISS](https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/2094303753986147) (free)
- Don't scratch **lenses**, clean them only with microfiber cloth. If you usually wear glasses, use the provided spacer, or (like me) don't wear them while you're in the headset.
- Set the headset in a **comfortable position**:
  1. loose all the straps
  2. wear the headset, and hold it with one hand, in a position in which you see the screen clearly. Adjust the distance between eyes if necessary.
  3. tighten the top strap first, so the bottom cord holds under the very back bone of the rear of your skull. (to take on some of the weight of the headset off the front of your head)
  4. then, tighten the side straps, so the headset remains in position even when you move your head.
  5. if needed, tilt the front, to balance the pressure equally between your forehead and your cheek bones.
- Chat and discover experiences with other Oculus Quest users from all around the world, on the ["Oculus Quest" Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/vrmai/).

## My favorite SideQuest games and experience

After [setting up SideQuest](https://sidequestvr.com/#/setup-howto) on your computer and VR headset, check out these awesome games:

- [Crisis VRigade](https://sidequestvr.com/#/app/38) is an excellent rail shooter (like Time Crisis) that is easy to understand but takes some practice to master. Hide behind cars and walls to avoid enemy bullets while you reload your gun. Don't forget to team up with some friends!
- [Pavlov: Shack](https://sidequestvr.com/#/app/392) is basically "counterstrike" for VR. You can play against bots but I guess that it's more fun with a team of friends.
- [Tea For God](https://sidequestvr.com/#/app/65) is a futuristic shooting game that will adapt to your playing room, so you can move into rooms and elevators by actually walking infinitely, without ever running into a wall. It's very hard to describe, you gotta experience it yourself!
- [QuakeQuest](https://sidequestvr.com/#/app/93) and [Quake2Quest](https://sidequestvr.com/#/app/353) are ports of the well-known 1st-person shooters on Oculus Quest. The six degrees of freedom enabled by Oculus Quest bring them to another level!
- [Lambda1 VR](https://sidequestvr.com/#/app/124) is a port of Half-Life on Oculus Quest. Like for Quake and Quake 2, you will have to upload the data files from the PC game. (I think it works with the free demo, too)
- [Descent Alps](https://sidequestvr.com/#/app/668) is a ski simulator in which you turn by leaning your weight in the direction of the turn.
