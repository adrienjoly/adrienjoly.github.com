# 3. Focus

- Bin of thoughts

- Content first

???

- find way to get ideas out of your mind quickly
- find ways to really focus, shut down interruptions, close non-necessary apps and tabs
- plan distractions (ex: facebook)
- group social interactions into small chunks, at distant intervals
- inform others of your intents, and comm. preferences (how to reach you)
- structure -> content -> details. (ex: use an outliner and/or markdown)

# 4. Take a step back

- Feel
- Adjust
- Share

???

- At end of each period (day, week, 13-week objective), take time to think of what you did (vs your initial expectations), 
- don't be too hard on yourself => just adapt your level of expectations, process, and/or tools.
- share your journey and learnings with others
