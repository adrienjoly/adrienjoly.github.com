    # My Trello Board
]

???

... finalement, je suis pas sur 10 projets mais 12 en ce moment. heureusement ce n'est que temporaire ! => teasing: mon board trello.

dans mon trello, je n'ai pas un board par projet, mais une carte par projet !

je me présente:

- j'enseigne 1j/semaine la prog javascript à l'EEMI
- je joue de la batterie dans un groupe
- je lance un MOOC sur la création de startup
- TO SHIP: quelques projets de développement + burning man
- TO MAINTAIN: next step, marketing, side projs, PDEV...

# Multi-bootstrapping

- story:
    1. startup dev: 4.5 years
    2. freelancer: 1.5 years
    3. now: try my own ideas => make my own products
- objective: create income independently
    - challenges: finding product-market fit, and waiting for xp results
    - decision: boostrap several projects at the same time
- productivity workflow => high efficiency w/o burn out

My workflow:

- 13-week process
- Weekly process
- Daily process
- Per-project process

???

inspiré par "self journal":
- deadline à 13 semaines pour mon objectif
- chaque semaine, je planifie et mesure mon avancement
- chaque jour aussi.

maintenant on va rentrer dans le détail de chaque process.

# 13-week process

???

- 1 final "result" goal
- 3 progress goals (metrics)
- 3 actions per progress goal
- 1 commitment (e.g. date)
- expected impact <- WHY
- reward
- habits intended, for good execution

Every week:

    # Weekly: next steps
]

???

- Next steps must be precise and ordered for each project
- Must be able to estimate the duration of each next step
- I made an extension for that => we'll get back to this later

???

[ FOR MAKER-SCHEDULE PEOPLE ONLY ]

When I know how much time per project + what steps to do:

- schedule the steps in my calendar
- leave some free time, just in case
- make a snapshot, then adjust the calendar to what I actually did

=> I know exactly:

- what I'm supposed to do, at all times
- what tasks I can move, and to when
- when I'm free to other things

- Feel
- Adjust

???

- At end of each period (day, week, 13-week objective), take time to think of what you did (vs your initial expectations), 
- don't be too hard on yourself => just adapt your level of expectations, process, and/or tools.
- share your journey and learnings with others
