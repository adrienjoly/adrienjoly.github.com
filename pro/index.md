My name is Adrien Joly (_he/him_), based in Paris, France (CET).

I have been a professional software engineer since 2006.

I have also been teaching back-end web development in several schools, since 2015.

I care about producing software this is both durable and useful, by aligning and retrospecting regularly with technical and functional collaborators.

On this page, I share the types of services I can provide to your business, my background, values and availability.

### Services

I can help your business by providing the following services:

- **Software development**: I design, develop and maintain web-based software products and data processing scripts;
- **Software Craft**: I refactor legacy code, apply TDD/DDD/BDD methodologies and pair/mob programming to reduce technical debt, to align the code with business expectations and constraints, and to maintain (or reach) a healthy development velocity;
- **Tech leadership**: I help team-members grow and align their practices, to make sure that they can work efficiently and that the codebase stays clean;
- **Strategic software consulting**: I can act as an _on-demand CTO_, to audit your technical assets and provide recommendations on how to bootstrap or grow your business efficiently.

### Experience

Always fascinated by computers, I wrote my first scripts and programs at the age of 6. During my career, I carried several roles in various environments:

- **Research** engineer and researcher, respectively at Gemalto and Alcatel-Lucent Bell Labs;
- Technical **leader** in several startup companies, including Whyd and Algolia;
- **Teacher** in several schools, including EEMI, ESGI and Web School Factory; (in Paris)
- and I have **developed** and maintained many products as a contractor and entrepreneur – mostly open-source.

In terms of technical stack and skills:

- I've been developing software with **Node.js** (mostly) since 2012, but I'm used to learn new technologies and to adapt to different environments and constraints.
- I know how to setup, develop and maintain a Web application **across the stack**: back-end & front-end development, automated testing, debugging, continuous integration, deployment, monitoring and other operations in production.

### Values

All my career, I've strived to grow as an **efficient and accountable** professional. As a person, I'm honest, open-minded and seek harmony – rather than competition – with my peers. I value people who share my thirst for life-long learning and sharing of knowledge.

I'm driven by:

- Writing software that is **useful**, by taking the time to listen and understand the vision and goal of its owners and end-users;
- Writing software **efficiently**, by discussing what's the most impactful and lean next step we can implement towards reaching that goal;
- Writing software that **works as expected**, by clarifying iteratively the underlying expectations and implementing them as automated tests and/or documentation;
- Writing software that is **sustainable to maintain**, by helping the team commit to shared programming and communication guidelines, and by promoting practices like TDD and pair/mob programming;
- Writing software that contributes to **making the world a better place**, by declining projects that contribute to the development of social precarity, violence, pollution and waste, more generally.

My objective is to help your software team (re)gain **confidence, autonomy and serenity** while creating (or sustaining) **value** for your business.

Note: I particularly enjoy contributing to projects related to music, education and improving people's lives.

### Availability

In March, 2020, I joined the consulting agency [SHODO](https://shodo.io/) to grow with a community of like-minded professionals and practice my skills as a Software Crafter.

I'm available for missions as a contractor (through SHODO), up to 4 days per week.

I am accustomed to work remotely, from Montreuil ~ Paris, France – in the CET timezone.
