My name is Adrien Joly (_he/him_), I have been a professional software engineer since 2006.

I have also been teaching back-end web development in several schools, since 2015.

### Services

I can help your business by providing the following services:

- **Software development**: I design, develop and maintain web-based software products and data processing scripts;
- **Software Craft**: I refactor code, apply TDD/DDD/BDD methodologies and pair/mob programming to reduce technical debt, to align functional logic and processes with business requirements and constraints, and to maintain a healthy development velocity;
- **Tech leadership**: I help team-members grow and align their practices, to make sure that they can work efficiently and that the codebase stays healthy;
- **Strategic software consulting**: I can act as an _on-demand CTO_, to audit your business technical assets and provide recommendations on how to bootstrap or grow your start-up company efficiently.

### Experience

Always fascinated by computers, I wrote my first scripts and programs at the age of 6. During my career, I carried several roles in various environments:

- **Research** engineer and researcher, respectively at Gemalto and Alcatel-Lucent Bell Labs;
- Technical **leader** in several startup companies, including Whyd and Algolia;
- **Teacher** in several schools, including EEMI, ESGI and Web School Factory; (in Paris)
- and I have **developed** and maintained many products as a contractor and entrepreneur – mostly open-source.

In terms of technical stack and skills:

- I've been developing software with Node.js (mostly) since 2012, but I'm used to learn new technologies and to adapt to different environments and constraints.
- I know how to setup, develop and maintain a Web application across the stack: back-end & front-end development, automated testing, debugging, continuous integration, deployment, monitoring and other operations in production.

### Values

All my career, I've strived to grow as an **efficient and accountable** professional, and did my best to pick projects that were aligned with my passions and/or values.

I deeply care about contributing to **make the world a better place**, by writing sustainable software and by declining projects that contribute to the development of social precarity, violence, pollution and waste, more generally. When it's possible, I particularly enjoy contributing to projects related to music, education and improving people's lives.

I join teams:

- who **care** about mutual respect, personal well-being and emotional safety;
- who are **honest and transparent** about their goals and intentions;
- who are **open** to new ideas and opinions, and seek harmony rather than competition;
- who are eager to keep **growing and learning**, as professionals and human beings;
- who **embrace the uncertainty** of developing a project, while doing the best they can.

### Availability

In March, 2020, I decided to join the consulting agency [SHODO](https://shodo.io/) in order to practice my skills as a Software Crafter, to grow with like-minded professionals. As such, I am not looking for _permanent_ work opportunities at the moment.

Based in Paris, France (CET), I'm available for remote missions.
